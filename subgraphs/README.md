# Echoes - subgraphs

Everything can be cloned and run locally, though the easiest way to get started is to visit the [website](https://echoes.polarzero.xyz).

This repo contains the subgraphs for all chains supported by Echoes.

- Ethereum Goerli
- Polygon Mumbai
- Arbitrum Goerli

The first one is deployed on The Graph Studio, the other two are deployed on the Hosted Service.
